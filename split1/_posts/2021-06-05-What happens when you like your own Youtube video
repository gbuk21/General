title: What happens when you ‘like’ your own Youtube video?

<H4>What happens when you click on ‘like’ button on your own Youtube video?</H4>


<H4>Youtube studio may show it in the no of likes initially but will be removed after a while(in hours). 
It does not seem to make any difference with respect to impressions.</H4>
