This video shows backtesting for the last 30 years on 4% rule with funds invested in S&P index and Vanguard total bond funds.
My hypothesis is to have 5 years of expected withdrawals in bonds may be sufficient to ride out the stock market volatility. Rest can be invested in stocks to maximize the returns. Historically stocks returned 8% and bonds around 3.85%.

Initial assumptions are inflation at 3%, starting stock funds value at 1.43 million and bond funds at 370k. Starting withdrawal amount is at $72000. 1.8 million multiplied by 4% = 72000.

All the withdrawals will happen from bond funds to account for spending and every year stocks returned more than 4%, bond funds will be replenished in order to have 5 years worth of withdrawals always available in bond funds. This amount will be at 1.25 times that year's withdrawal amount.

We will be using last 30 years actual returns from S&P and Vanguard total bonds for this backtesting. So we will be using stock and bond returns from 1994 to 2023.

Year1 starts with 1.43 million in stocks, 370k in bonds  and ends with a return of 0.4% for stocks with stock total reaching to 1.43million and bonds return -2.66 to take bond funds to 288k. Plese note that 72000 is withdrawn from bond funds.

Year2 - starting amount at 1.34 million afte replenishing the bond fund with 92700 which 1.25 times 74k which year2's withdrawal amount. Year2 stocks return 38% taking stock funds value to 1.85million and bond funds return 18% taking bond funds total to 359k.

Year7,8,9 are down years for stocks so no replenishment to bonds. This is one of the reasons to have 5 years of withdrawals in bond funds to allow for downtime and recovery.

At the end of 30 years,we will be left with 8.5 million in stocks and 590k in bonds.

This backtesting validates that having only 5 years of to be withdrawn amount in bond funds at any given time may be sufficient to ride out the stock market volatility and increase total returns.
