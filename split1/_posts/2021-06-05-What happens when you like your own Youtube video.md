title: What happens when you ‘like’ your own Youtube video?
---

<H4>What happens when you click on ‘like’ button on your own Youtube video?</H4>


<H4>Youtube studio may show it in the no of likes initially but will be removed after a while(in hours). 
It does not seem to make any difference with respect to impressions.
When you rewatch the video, your like will still be there. Like counts will reflect your like as well on youtube.com but not youtube studio.</H4>
